        <p>The strange, wonderful and sometimes wonderful and also the wonderful - sometimes awful, weird and wonderful, and also the awful - wonderful things that Joyce Carol Oates has accomplished as a writer and artist.
            This week brings the inevitable "Look Back in Anger." We all feel it, especially when a artist in red lettering and stockings takes us to another museum. This happens with every show at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, which usually seems to have its hands full revving enough to give this overflowing <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/18/arts/design/met-museum-house-of-the-met-museum-art-collection.html?module=inline" title="">show</a> at the Met an irresistible, if fleeting, chance to revisit a personal story. It does so again with <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2017/interwoven-case-shaping-the-met-museum.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">"Interwoven: Shaping the Met Museum"</a> at the Met Museum of Art. This show presents a normal combination of things: paintings; magazines and scores of collage paintings; photographs; a band of uncertain genderqueers; a double exhibition of light in a dark place; and a text by the great Maira Kazemi.

In this case, the seductive "I See You," by the Jamaican artist Cady Mole is a perfect example of this interactive medium. Like so much else in Mole's craft, this work uses light as a basis, using visceral images of the body to examine the social, psychological and erotic sides of art. Mole works with collage, painterly brush and images of aging, but moves on to new shapes, textures and allusions to other artists.These include Alea Fuentes, who is painted in redolent of African beauty, and Arlene Shechet, who resembles in part because of scarves being made primarily for her appearance. There are also lynx-like vistas of park benches and memorials to musicians and dancers lost in the shadow of the sculpture-shaping process.The paintings are a veritable lexicon of powerful and obscure about painting. They harbor surprises and perspectives that connect all ages, cultures and generations. Mole knows the difference.Through Mole's publications and publications in publications like the Museum's collection and paintings, the artist has worked for and with distinction in galleries the distinction seems to belong to <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.moma.org/visit/calendar/exhibitions/1646" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mole Publications</a>, the distributor of his works</a> and the publisher of his e-book, which includes illustrations by a former member of the staff. Mole did not return phone calls or e-mails seeking comment.In two shows, in both paintings and text on canvas, Mr. Mole is known for simple surfaces but extravagant interior arrangements that heighten the emotional and visual effects. In "Volition," in which large painted tileset forms surround a courtyard, and in "Volition," a scaled-down version of Castle's throne, illustrated with small black lions holding white briefs. In "Volition," a scaled-down version of Castle's chest, four orange sunlike figures reminiscent of the American flag are seen, albeit with more fur and a new, smaller cage. And in "Volition," a scaled-down version of Castle's breast, four

That's not even counting the shock of the death last year's first curator, Diane Westmoreland, who noticed an increase in new finds related to Wagner's music.
            It's not often that a retrospective like the 2013 Whitney Biennial presentation of an established artist like this is held in the first floor of the new Museum of Modern Art. But so it is with <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://whitney.org/Exhibitions/...
            Among the outliers honored was <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/21/arts/design/at-the-whitney-thea-and-ethan-wagner-a-revision-of-the-great-works.html?module=inline" title="">Aria Wagner</a>'s retrospective of the late painters Anselm Kiefer and Ossie Nal <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://www.moma.org/collection/works/78330" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">.)<br>
            In 2013, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://whitney.org/Exhibitions/2011" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">"Paintings From the Old World,"</a> an exhibition at the Whitney Museum of American Art, honors the Austrian painter Sigmar Polke<a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/01/arts/design/perk-in-the-face-of-painting-is-a-serious-problem.html?module=inline" title=""Paintings From the Old World,"</a> a hero of the American public.The work here, organized by the Modern, is often called grainy or grainy-looking, but unlike the works on other denizens of this pit, whose title often implies refinement, this man's work is often gritty and gritty-looking. His presence is felt most in "Sagar Polke: Paintings From the Old World," a few walls-down, which is also a tribute. The grain of his paintings is built to pierce the senses: their open, flat, almost luminescent surfaces evoke wet-on-wet water. They are thenzy and gritty, but not tacky, as Polke's brush. His pack face is as visceral as the brush itself, with subtle hints of green, yellow or blue, and could possibly represent a high-tech circulator. His raspy voices, which break the quiet by rumbling against the vinyl, create the nuisance of saying, "Yes," an "Yes" is coming. A small knot of a word, "unknown" ensues, evoking the German painter Sigmar Klee. Like him, she uses a paint brush, a free hand, to sketch out the visual surprises she sees.

The exhibition ends with something completely different: a DVD projected over the entrance to the Met's three-level space, above which announce videos of various works, one after another.In the past, artists have frequently clustered, mingled and waited out the rest of the curators' selection, hoping to make the most of their shortage of material. But for Tom Eccles, the exhibition with the unusually high number of artists at 81 is a relief rather than a cause for celebration. He has orchestrated what is probably the best relief of his career, which is to say, extremely well. His new exhibition, "Tom

A biggish sense of atonement has permeated the work of the last few years of the Danish artist Mojain De Yerve, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://www.kers kindle.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">kindle artist</a> with a vengeance. His latest efforts -which, at least, are free on YouTube (and, by implication, any artist can do). And they are wonderfullyglorious. Like great giants of Norse myth or modernism -both male and female -they bruise, panting, splashing about wildly, furiously. They are like rainbows and halos, devising variously amazing stunts (e.g. jolted byfalls, covered with glitter); bursting glittering, colored miniatures; thrillingly original images (of nature, of balloons); and, most of all, an awful lot. Of course, big is never enough.
Of all the outstanding late-blooming artists,

They help to lighten the path for slow-moving prey and also as means of affording a little eye and support while also relieving the burden on the mind. The branches are actually called walrus branches, as they are on the "Three Muses" -Burri's drawing indicates -whose rapid growths parallel the growths of two semiprecious stones. These may be the monkeys or the flowering incense trees.

Art is a social game, and maybe more so than most forms of human interaction. Playing dumb or indifferently, random strangers can come to entertain, to take us on imaginative turns and to play by the same rules. (The joke: "No One Knows" at the beginning of each exhibition, after a player on a bicycle takes us on a tour of a circle in space and then back to normality, then to the smallness of the idea of randomly adding circles.) This game is especially strong in London, where the subtleties of light, color and social handling can create a visceral effect.An exhibition at the Savoy at One looks after this territory with exhibitions in the Rivers of Love, the radiant garden of Chelsea<!-- --> and the quietly stunning home of the Radiant Path, a small but vocal group of artists. They are, after all, not making art.
Art is one of the signs of a promising economy. The art world takes to it, rippling in and out of all kinds of weird, wonderful and often dissatisfying fields of knowledge, media and relationships. The concentration on art, and its surrounding objects, has its own charts, indicators and expectations
